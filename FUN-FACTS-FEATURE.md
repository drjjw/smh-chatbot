# Fun Facts Loading Feature

## Overview
Added an engaging loading experience that displays random medical facts about kidneys and urine while users wait for AI responses.

## Implementation

### Files Created
- **`public/js/facts.js`** - Contains 55 medically-accurate fun facts (20 kidney facts + 35 urine facts)

### Files Modified
1. **`public/js/ui.js`**
   - Updated `addLoading()` to include fact display with rotation
   - Added `startFactRotation()` function to cycle through facts every 5 seconds
   - Updated `removeLoading()` to clean up the fact rotation interval
   - Added fade-in/fade-out transitions

2. **`public/css/styles.css`**
   - Added `.loading-container` styles for flex layout
   - Added `.loading-dots` styles for the animated dots
   - Added `.fun-fact` styles with fade animations
   - Included mobile-responsive adjustments

3. **`build.js`**
   - Added `facts.js` to the build pipeline for distribution

## Features

### Visual Design
- **Loading Dots**: Three animated dots indicating processing
- **Fact Display**: Medical facts shown in an italicized, styled box with:
  - Light gray background (`#f9f9f9`)
  - Red left border accent (`#cc0000`)
  - Subtle padding and rounded corners

### Behavior
- **Initial Load**: Random fact appears immediately when loading starts with random prefix
- **Rotation**: Facts change every 8 seconds with smooth fade transitions
- **Random Prefixes**: Each fact is prepended with either **"Fun fact:"** or **"Did you know?"** (in bold)
- **Fade Effect**: 
  - 600ms fade-out
  - New fact loads with new random prefix
  - 600ms fade-in
- **Cleanup**: Rotation automatically stops when loading completes

### Medical Accuracy
All facts are written in proper medical terminology and include:
- Kidney anatomy and physiology
- Renal function and filtration
- Historical medical practices
- Clinical significance
- Urine composition and characteristics

### Examples of Facts (with random bold prefixes)
- "**Fun fact:** Renal function can be maintained with a single kidney – unilateral nephrectomy patients typically experience normal renal capacity."
- "**Did you know?** Each kidney contains approximately 1-1.5 million functional nephrons – the fundamental filtration units of renal tissue."
- "**Fun fact:** Urine contains over 3,000 distinct metabolites – reflecting comprehensive renal filtration and metabolic excretion."

## Mobile Responsiveness
- Smaller font sizes on mobile (12px vs 13px)
- Reduced padding for compact display
- Maintains readability on all screen sizes

## Build System
The feature is fully integrated into the build pipeline:
- `facts.js` is hashed and copied to `dist/`
- Import statements are automatically updated
- All files are cache-busted for deployment

## Testing
To test locally:
1. Run `npm start` to start the development server
2. Open the chat interface
3. Send a message and observe the loading indicator
4. Facts should appear and rotate every 5 seconds

## Deployment
Build the distribution files:
```bash
npm run build
```

The feature will automatically be included in `dist/` ready for deployment.
