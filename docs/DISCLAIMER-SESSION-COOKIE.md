# Session Cookie Implementation

## Overview

The disclaimer now uses a **session cookie** instead of a persistent cookie. This means the cookie expires when the user closes their browser, and they will need to accept the disclaimer again in each new browser session.

## Benefits of Session Cookies

### 1. **Better Privacy**
- Cookie doesn't persist on user's device
- Automatically cleared when browser closes
- Reduces long-term tracking concerns

### 2. **Regular Acknowledgment**
- Users see disclaimer each session
- Ensures they're regularly reminded of terms
- Better for educational/medical applications

### 3. **Compliance**
- Some privacy regulations prefer session cookies
- Less data retention = less privacy risk
- Easier to comply with "right to be forgotten"

### 4. **Security**
- Shorter lifetime = smaller attack window
- Automatically expires = less maintenance
- No need to implement cookie cleanup

## Technical Implementation

### Cookie Settings

```javascript
// Session cookie (current implementation)
Cookies.set(COOKIE_NAME, 'Yes', { 
    path: '/'
    // No expires property = session cookie
});
```

**Key Point**: By omitting the `expires` property, js-cookie creates a session cookie that expires when the browser is closed.

### Browser Behavior

| Action | Cookie Status | Disclaimer Behavior |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| Accept disclaimer | Session cookie set | Won't show again this session |
| Refresh page | Cookie still exists | Won't show |
| New tab (same session) | Cookie still exists | Won't show |
| Close browser | Cookie deleted | - |
| Open browser again | No cookie | Disclaimer shows |

## User Experience

### Same Session (Browser Open)
1. User accepts disclaimer
2. Session cookie is set
3. User can:
   - Refresh the page ✅
   - Open new tabs ✅
   - Navigate away and back ✅
   - All without seeing disclaimer again

### New Session (Browser Closed & Reopened)
1. User closes browser
2. Session cookie is deleted
3. User opens browser again
4. Disclaimer appears again
5. User must accept again

## Testing Session Cookies

### Test 1: Within Same Session
```bash
1. Open app in browser
2. Accept disclaimer
3. Open DevTools → Application → Cookies
4. Verify cookie exists (no expiration date shown)
5. Refresh page → Disclaimer should NOT appear
6. Open new tab to same URL → Disclaimer should NOT appear
```

### Test 2: New Session
```bash
1. Open app in browser
2. Accept disclaimer
3. Close ALL browser windows (completely quit browser)
4. Open browser again
5. Navigate to app
6. Disclaimer should appear again
```

### Test 3: Incognito/Private Mode
```bash
1. Open app in incognito/private window
2. Accept disclaimer
3. Close incognito window
4. Open new incognito window
5. Navigate to app
6. Disclaimer should appear (session ended)
```

## Converting to Persistent Cookie (If Needed)

If you need the cookie to persist longer, you can easily change it:

### Option 1: Persistent Cookie (30 days)
```javascript
Cookies.set(COOKIE_NAME, 'Yes', { 
    path: '/',
    expires: 30  // days
});
```

### Option 2: Persistent Cookie (1 year)
```javascript
Cookies.set(COOKIE_NAME, 'Yes', { 
    path: '/',
    expires: 365  // days
});
```

### Option 3: Persistent Cookie (Custom Duration)
```javascript
const COOKIE_EXPIRY_DAYS = 90; // 3 months

Cookies.set(COOKIE_NAME, 'Yes', { 
    path: '/',
    expires: COOKIE_EXPIRY_DAYS
});
```

## Browser Compatibility

Session cookies are supported by all modern browsers:

- ✅ Chrome/Edge (all versions)
- ✅ Firefox (all versions)
- ✅ Safari (all versions)
- ✅ Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
- ✅ Internet Explorer 11+

## Privacy Considerations

### Session Cookie (Current)
- ✅ Minimal data retention
- ✅ Automatically cleaned up
- ✅ Better privacy compliance
- ⚠️ User sees disclaimer more often

### Persistent Cookie (Alternative)
- ⚠️ Longer data retention
- ⚠️ Requires manual cleanup
- ⚠️ More privacy concerns
- ✅ Better user experience (less interruption)

## Recommendation

**For medical/educational applications**: Session cookies are recommended because:

1. **Compliance**: Better for HIPAA, GDPR, and similar regulations
2. **Regular Acknowledgment**: Users are regularly reminded of terms
3. **Privacy**: Minimal data retention on user's device
4. **Security**: Shorter lifetime reduces risk

**For general applications**: Consider persistent cookies (30-90 days) if:

1. User experience is priority
2. Privacy regulations are less strict
3. Terms don't change frequently
4. Users access frequently

## Current Configuration

```javascript
// File: public/js/disclaimer.js

const COOKIE_NAME = '_ukidney_disclaimer_agree';
// Session cookie - expires when browser closes (no expiry date set)

// Cookie is set without expires property:
Cookies.set(COOKIE_NAME, 'Yes', { 
    path: '/'
    // No expires property = session cookie
});
```

## Troubleshooting

### Cookie persists after closing browser

**Possible causes**:
1. Browser has "Continue where you left off" enabled
2. Browser is restoring session
3. Browser wasn't fully closed (still running in background)

**Solution**:
- Fully quit browser (not just close window)
- Check browser settings for session restoration
- Test in incognito/private mode

### Cookie expires too quickly

**Possible causes**:
1. Browser is in private/incognito mode
2. Browser has aggressive privacy settings
3. Cookie is being blocked

**Solution**:
- Check browser privacy settings
- Verify cookies are enabled
- Test in normal (non-private) mode

### Cookie doesn't work across tabs

**This is expected behavior**:
- Session cookies work across tabs in the same browser session
- If tabs are in different sessions (e.g., different browser profiles), cookies won't be shared

## Summary

The disclaimer now uses a **session cookie** that:

✅ Expires when browser closes  
✅ Provides better privacy  
✅ Ensures regular acknowledgment  
✅ Complies with privacy regulations  
✅ Automatically cleans up  

Users will see the disclaimer once per browser session, which is appropriate for a medical/educational application.
